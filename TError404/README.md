PROJECT MEMBERS:
BTECH/10763/22 Akshat Tambi CSE 'A'

TECH STACK: Node.js, React.js, JWT, BCrypt, MongoDB

FEATURES:

● User Authentication:
Þ JWT is employed for secure user authentication, restricting access to authenticated users for posting items, engaging in conversations, and completing transactions, bolstering overall platform security.

● Item Posting:
Þ The dynamic item posting feature utilizes React.js components, allowing users to seamlessly upload images, provide descriptions, set prices, and specify details. The frontend will interact with the backend, storing information in the database for integrated marketplace listings.

● Real-Time Messaging:
Þ Real-time chat functionality will be implemented using WebSockets or similar protocols. React.js components manage the frontend chat interface, while the backend handle logic for message storage and retrieval, enabling instant communication between buyers and sellers.

● Backend Technologies:
Þ Node.js and Express.js power the backend, handling HTTP requests and routing. We are planning to use MongoDB, a NoSQL database, for storing user data, item listings, and transaction details. The backend will manage user authentication, item postings, chat functionality, and online payments.



Run Commands:

In frontend  folder, npm run dev
In backend folder, node index.js
Note: Host backend on port 3000, and frontend on some other port
